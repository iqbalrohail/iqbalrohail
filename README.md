### Hi Devs ðŸ‘‹
<h1 align="center">I am Rohail Iqbal</h1>
<p align="center"> <b><i>As a Data Platform Engineer, I specialize in building scalable, reliable, and production-grade data systems that power data-driven insights. With a strong foundation in core software engineering and distributed systems, I bring a systems-thinking approach to solving complex data challenges.

I design and develop end-to-end ETL/ELT pipelines, manage workflow orchestration using Apache Airflow and Prefect, and work across both OLAP and OLTP systems. My focus areas include modern data architectures, data observability, and automationâ€”leveraging technologies and tools such as Python, Java, Spark, Talend, Kafka, DBT, Soda, Alembic, Postgres, Snowflake, Clickhouse and Kubernetes.</i><b> </p>
